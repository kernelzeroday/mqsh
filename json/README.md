Json /bin/sh wrapper script for outputting shell commands as json objects for use in fancypants webdev programming or whatever

Exmaple mqtte call:
busybox mqtte -i 127.0.0.1 -t shell -t shell/127.0.0.1 -h localhost -- /home/kod/bin/jsonsh | mosquitto_pub -t data -h localhost -l

Example mqsh output:

kod@nb:~/mqsh$ node mqsh.js -s

mqtt.connect localhost

As you can see you get back the cmdline issued, the response as output, and a lot of other shit aswell such as execution time and kernel cmdline, memstats, a lot of shit you probably wont ever need but looks cool because we are fancy and use json. Useful for dumping into a database for analytics. Probably. 


Some shit gets mangled on purpose because I wrote this late last night. Other shit doesnt work at all, and some things work halfway. Catting a file is fucked up. Sometimes? Idk I will fix it.

A better approach foir the refactor will be to echo the format.json file instead of catting ir around into sed, I think using fs level buffers fucks shit up. For now its fine though, you can run stuff and get a response so whatever. 

Ideas for more shit to implement: 

May be wise to time all cmds and return the output as a field. 

Might be cool to do some sort of layered hierchical data output. Not sure if this is wise or not.

Need to fix openports to use netstat instead of ss cause bbn doesnt have ss
